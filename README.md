# Collections-and-File-IO

In this experiment, 
I gained experience on using different collections (dictionary, list and their functions) as well as on using File I \O. 
The scenario of this work is receiving a message which is split into multiple packets and transferred over the Internet. 
Packets are not received in order in which they are sent. 

My program is able to read the input file, sort the packets and write the completed messages to an output file. 
As you see from the input format, each line of input represents a single packet. Each line is formatted as given below: 
X (tab) Y (tab) message part 
X represents message ID, Y represents packet ID. It is guaranteed that there will be no duplicate packets or message IDs.
